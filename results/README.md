In `solution_quality_analysis.7z`, the structure is as follows:
```
solution_quality_analysis/
├── mean90_std90/ (actual power distribution params)
│   ├── 0/ (execution number)
│   │   ├── MCGreedy/
│   │   ├── Offline/
│   │   ├── Online_Bayesian/
│   │   ├── Online_DoNothing/
│   │   ├── Online_WeightedAvg/

```

where:
* `Offline` is the strategy that uses offline solutions only.
* `Online_DoNothing` (i.e., _ROMP_ in paper) re-plans at each node, utilizing prior travel costs estimated during the offline planning phase.
* `Online_WeightedAvg` (i.e., _WeightedErr_ in paper) is a heuristic-based method. It dynamically calculates the weighted error ratio between estimated and actual travel energy from the most recent travel.
* `MCGreedy` randomly samples N power levels between the minimum and maximum observed power consumption, with the final path determined by the candidate sequence with the highest occurrence frequency.
* `Online_Bayesian` is _ADAPT_ in paper.

Within each strategy directory, `exp_chrg_list.csv` is the solution generated by the online planner. It has the following format:

| Execution time (s) | Belief (if have) | Path prize (kJ) | Path cost (kJ) | Path indices |
|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|

`mission_log.csv` is the execution results that simulate real-world situations. It has the following format:

| UAV X coord (m) | UAV Y coord (m) | UAV Z coord (m) | UAV arrive time (s) | UAV arrive energy (kJ) | UAV leave time (s) | UAV leave energy (kJ) | this node recharged energy (kJ) |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|
